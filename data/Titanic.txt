James Cameron's 194 minute 200 million film of the tragic voyage is in the tradition of the great Hollywood epics it is flawlessly crafted intelligently constructed strongly acted and spellbinding the human story involved a 17 year old woman named Rose the UK de windswept who is sailing to what she sees as their own personal doom she has been forced by a penniless mother to become engaged to marry a rich supercilious knob named Cal Hockley Billy Zane and she hates this prospect so much that she tried to kill herself by jumping from the ship she is saved by Jack Dawson Leonardo DiCaprio a brass bed frame storage and of course they will fall in love during the brief time left them movies like this this or not merely difficult to make but almost impossible to make well the technical difficulties are so daunting that it's a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion I found myself convinced by both the story and the Saga the set-up of the Love Story is fairly routine but the payoff how everyone behaves as a ship is sinking is a wonderfully written as passengers are forced to make impossible choices
